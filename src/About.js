    <p><strong>Family:</strong></p>
      <p>  
        I live outside of Bloomington, IN with my wonderful wife and four children.  We enjoy serving our church and our small group. 
        We are avid DIYers, making crafts, furniture and interior construction. We are bad at sports and gardening.

     <p><strong>Computing:</strong></p>
     <p>
        I wrote my first HTML in 7th grade for a Star Trek fan page on Yahoo Geocities (I'm that old).
        In 2008 I began "real" coding by learning a little C++, and in 2009 began my IT career proper working in a helpdesk.
        I've always enjoyed web development, doing projects for jobs and independtly for clients.

     <p><strong>Education:</strong></p>
     <p>I have a bachelors degree in Information Technology from Western Governors University.</p>
